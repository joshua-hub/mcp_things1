# MCP Implementation Status

## 1. Server Implementation (`mcp-server/app/mcp_server/server.py`)
✅ **Completed**:
- Proper stdio-based communication using MCP SDK
- Tool registration with `@server.call_tool()` decorator
- Health endpoints (`/health`, `/ready`, `/metrics`)
- Prometheus metrics for tool execution
- Structured logging
- Error handling and tracking
- Server state management

## 2. Client Implementation (`mcp-client/app/mcp_client/client.py`)
✅ **Working**:
- Stdio-based communication using `ClientSession`
- Proper connection handling and cleanup
- Tool execution and listing capabilities

❌ **Missing**:
- Error handling and retries
- Health check integration
- Connection state management
- Metrics collection
- Logging

## 3. Middleware Implementation (`middleware/app.py`)
✅ **Working**:
- Health check implementation
- Error handling
- CORS middleware
- Service status tracking
- Tool request extraction
- Chat message handling

❌ **Needs Update**:
- Currently uses HTTP endpoints for MCP server communication
- Should be updated to use stdio-based communication
- Needs to integrate with client's stdio implementation
- Should add metrics collection
- Should add structured logging

## 4. Docker Configuration (`docker-compose.yml`)
**Needs Review**:
- Network configuration for stdio communication
- Environment variables for all services
- Startup order and dependencies
- Volume mounts for workspace
- Health check configurations
- Resource limits

## 5. Testing (`testing-mcp.py`)
**Needs Review**:
- Coverage for stdio communication
- Health endpoint testing
- Error handling scenarios
- Integration tests
- Performance testing
- Security testing

## Next Steps Priority

1. **High Priority**:
   - Update middleware to use stdio-based communication
   - Add error handling and retries to client
   - Review and update Docker configuration

2. **Medium Priority**:
   - Add metrics collection to client
   - Implement structured logging
   - Update testing implementation

3. **Low Priority**:
   - Add performance optimizations
   - Implement additional health checks
   - Add security hardening

## Questions to Address

1. How should the middleware handle stdio communication with multiple clients?
2. What retry strategies should be implemented for the client?
3. How should we handle workspace cleanup in the server?
4. What metrics are most important for monitoring?
5. How should we handle service discovery in the Docker environment?
